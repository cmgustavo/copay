# Copay

Copay is a secure bitcoin wallet platform for both desktop and mobile devices. Copay uses [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for peer synchronization and network interfacing.

This project was created by BitPay Inc, and it is maintained by BitPay and hundreds of contributors. There is a BitPay branded version of Copay at mobile phone stores, BitPay Wallet, which features integration with the BitPay Visa Debit Card, as its main difference.

## About Copay

### General

Copay implements a multisig wallet using [p2sh](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash) addresses. It supports multiple wallets, each with its own configuration, such as 3-of-5 (3 required signatures from 5 participant peers) or 2-of-3. To create a multisig wallet shared between multiple participants, Copay requires the extended public keys of all the wallet participants. Those public keys are then incorporated into the wallet configuration and combined to generate a payment address where funds can be sent into the wallet. Conversely, each participant manages their own private key and that private key is never transmitted anywhere.

To unlock a payment and spend the wallet's funds, a quorum of participant signatures must be collected and assembled in the transaction. The funds cannot be spent without at least the minimum number of signatures required by the wallet configuration (2-of-3, 3-of-5, 6-of-6, etc.). Once a transaction proposal is created, the proposal is distributed among the wallet participants for each to sign the transaction locally. Finally, when the transaction is signed, the last signing participant will broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin network.

Copay also implements [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) to generate new addresses for peers. The public key that each participant contributes to the wallet is a BIP32 extended public key. As additional public keys are needed for wallet operations (to produce new addresses to receive payments into the wallet, for example) new public keys can be derived from the participants' original extended public keys. Once again, it's important to stress that each participant keeps their own private keys locally - private keys are not shared - and are used to sign transaction proposals to make payments from the shared wallet.

For more information regarding how addresses are generated using this procedure, see: [Structure for Deterministic P2SH Multisignature Wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki).

### Copay Backups and Recovery

Since v1.2 Copay uses BIP39 mnemonics for backing up wallets. The BIP44 standard is used for wallet address derivation. Multisig wallets use P2SH addresses, while non-multisig wallets use P2PKH.

Information about backup and recovery procedures is available at: https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/backupRecovery.md

Previous versions of Copay used files as backups. See the following section.

It is possible to recover funds from a Copay Wallet without using Copay or the Wallet Service, check the [Copay Recovery Tool](https://github.com/bitpay/copay-recovery/tree/master).

### Wallet Export Format

Copay encrypts the backup with the [Stanford JS Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). To extract the private key of your wallet you can go to settings, choose your wallet, click in "more options", then "wallet information", scroll to the bottom and click in "Extended Private Key". That information is enough to sign any transaction from your wallet, so be careful when handling it!

The backup also contains the key `publicKeyRing` that holds the extended public keys of the Copayers.
Depending on the key `derivationStrategy`, addresses are derived using
[BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) or [BIP45](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0045.mediawiki). Wallets created in Copay v1.2 and forward always use BIP44, all previous wallets use BIP45. Also note that since Copay version v1.2, non-multisig wallets use address types Pay-to-PublicKeyHash (P2PKH) while multisig wallets still use Pay-to-ScriptHash (P2SH) (key `addressType` at the backup):

| Copay Version | Wallet Type               | Derivation Strategy | Address Type |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <1.2          | All                       | BIP45               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.2          | Non-multisig              | BIP44               | P2PKH        |
| ≥1.2          | Multisig                  | BIP44               | P2SH         |
| ≥1.5          | Multisig Hardware wallets | BIP44 (root m/48’)  | P2SH         |

Using a tool like [Bitcore PlayGround](http://bitcore.io/playground) all wallet addresses can be generated. (TIP: Use the `Address` section for P2PKH address type wallets and `Multisig Address` for P2SH address type wallets). For multisig addresses, the required number of signatures (key `m` on the export) is also needed to recreate the addresses.

BIP45 note: All addresses generated at BWS with BIP45 use the 'shared cosigner index' (2147483647) so Copay address indexes look like: `m/45'/2147483647/0/x` for main addresses and `m/45'/2147483647/1/y` for change addresses.

Since version 1.5, Copay uses the root `m/48'` for hardware multisignature wallets. This was coordinated with Ledger and Trezor teams. While the derivation path format is still similar to BIP44, the root was in order to indicate that these wallets are not discoverable by scanning addresses for funds. Address generation for multisignature wallets requires the other copayers extended public keys.

### Bitcore Wallet Service

Copay depends on [Bitcore Wallet Service](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet-service) (BWS) for blockchain information, networking and Copayer synchronization. A BWS instance can be setup and operational within minutes or you can use a public instance like `https://bws.bitpay.com`. Switching between BWS instances is very simple and can be done with a click from within Copay. BWS also allows Copay to interoperate with other wallets like [Bitcore Wallet CLI](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore-wallet).

Please note that Copay v5.3.0 and above use CSP to restrict network access. To use a custom BWS see [CSP announcement](https://github.com/bitpay/copay/blob/master/CSP.md).
